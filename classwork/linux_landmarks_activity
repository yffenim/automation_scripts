# visually (manually), I can see that Jack is suspect.
# Exploring his user home:
`find . -name "*.sh"` 

# I find two suspicious scripts. The first one is:
`nc -lvp 4444 > /tmp/rev_shell.sh &
renice -n 1 $(pidof nc)

# This looks like it wants to:
1. redirect the data from port 4444 to a shell script located at `/tmp/rev_shell.sh`
2. alter the scheduling priority of `nc` to be equal to "1" 

#But why? When I check for the `rev_shell.sh` script, it is not there.
